## Frequent Questions
#### How can I add a radio station
There are three ways to add a radio station to URL Radio: Use Search, add playlist file address (M3U, PLS), enter a raw stream address. The last way will not support the update feature.

#### How does the update feature work?
The update feature will try to fetch the current stream address of a station as well as the updated name and station image. The feature will not work for stations added via a raw stream address, or for stations imported from URL Radio v3.

#### Where do the radio station search results come from?
URL Radio searches the [radio-browser.info](http://www.radio-browser.info/) online database. You can help out the radio-browser.info community by [adding the missing station](http://www.radio-browser.info/gui/#!/add) to their database.

#### Which audio formats are supported?
URL Radio can play back streams encoded in MP3, AAC and Ogg/Opus. It also has experimental support for HLS streams.
